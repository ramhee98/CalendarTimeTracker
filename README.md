# CalendarTimeTracker

**CalendarTimeTracker** is a Streamlit (Python) app for analyzing how time is spent across multiple public `.ics` calendar URLs. It focuses on **event duration** rather than content and supports both **calendar-based** and **category-based** visualizations.

## 🚀 Features

- 📅 Load multiple calendars from `calendars.txt` or `calendars.json`
- 📊 Visualize total and relative time spent per month
- 🔥 Activity heatmap (weekday × hour)
- 🍰 Pie chart for calendar/category time distribution
- 📦 Summary tables with CSV export
- 🔄 Dynamically switch between viewing by **Calendar** or **Category**

## 🛠 Requirements
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure calendars in two ways with samples provided:

### Option 1: `calendars.txt`

A plain text file where each line contains a calendar URL and an optional name.

### Option 2: `calendars.json` (Preferred)

Supports rich metadata like category assignment.

If `calendars.json` is present, it will be used automatically and enables category-based grouping.

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will:

1. Load events from `.ics` calendar sources
2. Ask you to select a view mode (Calendar or Category) if using `calendars.json`
3. Let you choose a month range to analyze
4. Display multiple interactive charts and tables

## 📂 Output

- All data stays local
- Summary tables can be downloaded as CSV
- Visuals include tooltips and interactive features

## 🧠 Notes

- Time zone normalization is done as **naive** by default.
- Duplicate events are filtered using the event `UID` field.
- Caching reduces repeated loads for unchanged calendars.
